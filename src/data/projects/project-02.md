The Indian Armed Forces are the military forces of the Republic of India. It consists of three professional uniformed services: the Indian Army, Indian Navy, and Indian Air Force. I developed a dashboard which can be used to learn about the Indian Armed Forces.

This dashboard can be used by children of ages 6-14 to learn about the various regiments and gallantry awards won by our brave heroes, helping with important information and needed motivation.

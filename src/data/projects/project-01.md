<!-- ### Description -->

As you embark on this journey through the pages of our coffee table book dedicated to Sher-Gil’s extraordinary life and work, allow yourself to be transported into the vibrant tapestry of her artistic genius.
My sincere appreciation goes to AMRITA SHER GIL for her artistic brilliance, which served as the driving force behind this project. This coffee table book is a tribute to her enduring legacy, and I hope it captivates and inspires all who explore its pages.


Amrita Sher-Gil was to overhaul Indian art through the first half of the 20th century. Her works have been declared ‘**National Treasures**’ by the Government of India and a corpus of her paintings is housed in the National Gallery of Art, New Delhi. The baby was named **‘Amrita,’** after Amritsar, the ‘**tank of immortality.**’.
